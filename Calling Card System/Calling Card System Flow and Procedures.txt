💻 System Flow and Procedures Analysis
🔑 Admin Module (VB.NET WebView & NFC Bridge)
Platform: VB.NET desktop application1.
Interface: Uses a WebView to display the PHP website ($\text{admin/dashboard.php}$) and is designed to open on an "account Tab login" first.
NFC Bridging: The VB.NET application is essential for NFC Reader (ACR122u) compatibility, acting as the bridge to handle the card-tapping process for registration.

- Registration Flow:
	1. Admin enters employee details (first name, last name, email, etc.).
	2. Admin clicks a separate button for NDEF URL registration.
	3. The VB.NET application awaits an NFC card tap via the reader.	
	4. Upon tap, the VB.NET component reads the NFC UID and sends it to the database for storage.
	5. The VB.NET component then formats and writes the member's unique NDEF URL (e.g., 			https://myhostingwebsite.com/user/dashboard.php?{data}) to the NFC Card.
	6. The system creates a user account (default username: firstname + lastname + year, password: 123456) and sends credentials via SMTP 	email.

Functionalities:
- Data Management: Add, edit, and delete employee/card holder member data and login credentials.
- Company Section: Modify company details (logo, name, address, contact, social media, map location).
- Product Section: Upload and manage product images.
- Account Modification: Log in to enable editing/adding features and modify admin credentials.
- Admin Public View: Tapping the admin card on a phone shows a read-only user dashboard view, hiding sensitive admin details.

📱 User Module (PHP Webpage)
Interface: Pure website/webpage, fixed portrait design for mobile view.
Access: When the user taps their NFC Card on a phone, the NDEF URL is detected, which forces the phone's browser to open the user's dashboard URL (e.g., user/dashboard.php?{data}).
Display:
- Header: Logo (from admin settings) and an account tab.
- Personal: Profile picture, editable social media icons, and personal details.
- Company: Displays the company section as set by the admin (including the map).
- Products: Displays the product images uploaded by the admin.
Account Modification: To edit personal details or change the password, the user must click the account tab and log in with their credentials.

💾 NFC-NDEF Write Code Reference (VB.NET)
The NFC-NDEF_Write Code.txt sample code demonstrates the core functions the VB.NET NFC Bridge is designed to perform:
SCard Functions: Imports Windows Smart Card API functions (winscard.dll) for connecting to the reader, listing readers, and transmitting commands (SCardEstablishContext, SCardListReaders, SCardConnect, SCardTransmit, SCardDisconnect, SCardReleaseContext).
Encryption: The URL path is encrypted using AES (32-byte key, 16-byte IV) before encoding into the NDEF message, adding a layer of security to the unique user ID/path.
NDEF Encoding:
- It creates a URI NDEF Record by mapping common prefixes (e.g., https://, http://www.) to a 1-byte URI Identifier Code (&H1 to &H4) and stripping the prefix from the URL string, thus saving space on the tag.
- It wraps the NDEF Record with an NDEF Message TLV (Tag &H3) and a Terminator TLV (&HFE).
Card Writing:
- It uses the APDU Command &HFF, &HD6 (Write Binary) to write the NDEF data.
- Data is written in 4-byte pages (NTAG213 standard) starting at Page.
